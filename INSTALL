BUILD AND INSTALLATION
----------------------

Configure & Build from source:
    $ autoreconf -i  # generate the configure script and Makefile.in files

On Linux, OSX and FreeBSD:
    $ ./configure [--prefix=PREFIX]
    $ make

On OpenSolaris:
    $ ./configure [--prefix=PREFIX]
    $ gmake

To install:
    $ sudo make install

* Replace PREFIX with the filesystem path under which Traffic Server
  should be installed.  Default PREFIX is "/usr/local" (without the
  quotes).

* If you want to build using different layout see the config.layout
  file for possible alternatives. You can create your own layout
  and enable it with ./configure --enable-layout=ID, where ID is
  the layout name you have created.

* The easiest way to find all of the configuration flags
  for Traffic Server is to run ./configure --help.

To build the examples in example directory use
    $ make examples

To installl the examples inside current layout libexecdir use the
    $ sudo make install-examples

By default the build will use the highest level of compiler
optimization. To alter this, specify your own optimizer flags at
configuration time:

    $ ./configure CXXFLAGS=-Os CFLAGS=-Os
